# SIEM Detection Home Lab

## Objective

The SIEM Detection Home Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned 

- Understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Kali Linux CMD for generating NMAP commands which were detected by the SIEM that was built using Elastic.
- Elastic Website to create rules to detect and log security events.
